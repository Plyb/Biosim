I think we're going to need to do this in at least two separate workspaces unfortunately.
Here is the plan, 3 projects
1. library crate project that has the "kernel"
2. bevy project that can read from (1) on the cpu in debug mode if needed, and can read the outputted file from (3) in gpu mode
3. rust-gpu project that relies on (1) and outputs a compiled spirv file to (2)
then, we'll create a bat file that runs them in the correct order.
Note: we may be able to combine 1 and 2 into a single project, which would be great for tooling purposes.
